Welcome to sitelen leko!

What is sitelen leko?
Sitelen leko is a script I designed originally for a separate project that happened to work somewhat similarly to toki pona. After putting the project on Hiatus I decided to repurpose the script for toki pona. Why would I do this and not just use sitelen pona? Well, unfortunately I’ve never been a huge fan of sitelen pona both functionally and aesthetically. Before you pull out your pitchforks, just know that I concede two things: Aesthetically, sitelen pona is very cute, just not my cup of tea. And when I say “functionally” I’m not suggesting sitelen pona doesn’t function well, it does - very well. To understand what I mean you have to understand my goals when adapting this script…

And for this please see the sitelen leko guide
