o kama pona a tawa sitelen leko!
Welcome to sitelen leko!

What is sitelen leko?
Sitelen leko is a script I designed originally for a separate project that happened to work somewhat similarly to toki pona. After putting the project on Hiatus I decided to repurpose the script for toki pona. Why would I do this and not just use sitelen pona? Well, unfortunately I’ve never been a huge fan of sitelen pona both functionally and aesthetically. Before you pull out your pitchforks, just know that I concede two things: Aesthetically, sitelen pona is very cute, just not my cup of tea. And when I say “functionally” I’m not suggesting sitelen pona doesn’t function well, it does - very well. To understand what I mean you have to understand my goals when adapting this script…

What were my goals when adapting?
I have always had reasons for being dissatisfied with sitelen pona and for many years have tried to develop various other ways to write toki pona. Eventually, I learned to use and read sitelen pona so I could understand where it shines and where it falls short. That being said, there were two large goals to tackle: Ambiguity and Legibility. What do I mean when I say these were my goals?  Ambiguity:
Toki pona is naturally an ambiguous language and that is OKAY. I have no problem with this in general, but what if there was a way to eliminate SOME ambiguity without changing the way the language functions at all? What if when writing (the primary way users consume material for toki pona) there were intuitive visual clues that could terminate some of this ambiguity? This is a question I toyed with in many different ways with many different attempts to create a new writing system.

Legibility:
I consider toki pona to have three major categories for the syntactic role a word can play: Particles, Content words and (what I call) function words. What does this have to do with legibility? Well, let’s take a detour to Japanese and try to understand where I’m coming from.  For those of you who have never studied Japanese or don’t know much about the language, it has three writing system each with their own function for written communication. 
First: Kanji! These are characters borrowed from Chinese which carry semantic meaning.
Second: Hiragana! A script native to Japan (derived from Kanji) that represents the language phonetically.
Last: Katakana! Similar in function to Hiragana but different in use.

There are distinct visual differences between these three scripts and along with these visual differences there are also functional differences. Kanji is used to derive semantic meaning and Hiragana carries much of the grammatical weight. Here is an example with Kanji in red and Hiragana in yellow; 私は食堂で魚を食べま. Hopefully it is noticeable the visual differences here. Kanji tend to be more complex with many straight and angled lines, while Hiragana tend to be simpler and often have more curvature to them. These visual queues can quickly tell the reader (even novice learners) where semantic meaning ends and grammar begins.

This is something I wanted to achieve with toki pona as well. I wanted visual queues that could quickly tell the reader what part of toki pona’s grammatical patterns they are looking at. 

These goals of mine are things I tried to achieve in various ways through many different attempted scripts, but i kept being pulled back to the idea that the original script sitelen leko is adapted from would work perfectly. So eventually I caved in and took the leap to adapt it and officially create sitelen leko.
